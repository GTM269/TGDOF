# TGDOF
# TGDOF  This is the testing code of TGDOF for CS-MRI.  Running the script  "AddPath" and then the "Demo_TGDOF" to test the basic deep framework for CS-MRI.   TestData ------------ The testing MR slices used in experiments, including 25 T1-weighted data and 25 T2-weighted data. The slices are extracted from the subset of the IXI datasets: http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/  ArtifactsModel ------------ The pre-trained model used in Module \mathcal{N}.  SamplingPatter: ------------ The three kinds of sampling patterns at five different sampling ratios (10% to 50%).
